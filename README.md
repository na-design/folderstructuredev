Work in the DEV folder and use gulp when developing site
Then use gulp build to run minify for all files and optimise images.

Remember to do run the `npm install` command after cloning this repo :)

use sassdoc dev to output sassdoc files.

Work from the 'dev/files/pages' folder which outputs to 'dev/'
